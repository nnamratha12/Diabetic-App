# Type-I-diabetes-App
### Project is a collaboration with Stephanie Senteris from CIBC

Type I diabetes keeps a record of their food intake in order to estimate the ratio of carbohydrates to insulin. However, all the estimations need to be calculated manually and entered. Implementing an app that can collect the required information and analyze would benefit type I patients. In addition, if the app can interact with the patient to certain questions, they feel someone is there for them.
